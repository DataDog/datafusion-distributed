/// Extension point for building user-defined work unit streams consumed by a

///
/// Implement this trait on a type that knows how to produce the per-partition stream of
/// work items (e.g. file addresses, external queries, key ranges) that the leaf plan needs
/// at runtime. Then wrap the implementation with [`crate::WorkUnitFeed::new`] and store
/// the resulting [`crate::WorkUnitFeed`] as a field of your [`ExecutionPlan`] node.
///
/// In a distributed context the provider is only invoked on the **coordinating** stage
/// that initiates the query. The work units it produces are serialized and streamed over
/// the network to the workers, which expose the same typed stream to the leaf plan as if
/// it were running locally.
///
/// See [`WorkUnitFeedProvider::feed`] for the per-call contract.

    /// This method is never invoked in a remote worker. On workers, the equivalent
    /// leaf plan uses a remote provider that pulls the work units off the network —
    /// user code doesn't need to implement that case.
    ///
    /// When implementing this method, [DistributedWorkUnitFeedContext] can be extracted from
    /// the [TaskContext], and it contains information about the amount of distributed tasks to
    /// which [WorkUnit]s should be fanned out.

    /// The implementation should be prepared to return `P*T` feeds, where `P` is the number of
    /// partitions of the [datafusion::physical_plan::ExecutionPlan] to which the
    /// [WorkUnitFeedProvider] is attached and `T` is the number of tasks to which it should fanout
